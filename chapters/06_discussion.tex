% PUt key takeaways also here, why it didnt work so well with the chainign hashtable, and some compilers liek clang performeed worse than gcc
% also the fact tha t different architectures have different performance gains

discussion of evaluatin of datastructure and duckdb

duckdb paritally it works good but not as inj linear hashtable and other datastructures




unexpected that it peaks with medium datasize s and then goes down again with 4gB upwards, possible explanations:
- cpu cache effects
- not in all 3 caches storable



Future work:
- more datastructures, like ART Tree, LSM Trees, other hashtables (cuckoo, hopscotch)
- more architectures (ARM, NUMA, RISC-V)
- more compilers (MSVC)
- more real world systems (other dbms, key value stores, ...)
- more finetuning in duckdb
