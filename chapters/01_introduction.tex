\section{Motivation}
Citation test~\parencite{latex}.

How can Coroutines hide latencies for hashtable/bptree lookups?
What is the performance gain generally?
What is the performance gain in duckdb?

How does the performance gain differ between various architectures? (Intel x86 vs ARM vs NUMA)
What about Threading and Coroutines? Hyperthreading/NUMA




\section{Related Work}
boost coro, other async concepts, other works regarding coroutine implemenmtation
a lot of work on coroutines microbenchmarking on one machine with one compiler but not acrosos machines and compilers

relatedw ork concentrat on coroutines, but nto checking it out in real db sytem,

this master thesis paves the way for further research in this area by integrating it into duckdb
